# 🧹 User Review Data Cleaning & Product Recommendation

## 📌 Project Overview
This mini project demonstrates how to:
- Clean messy user review data
- Convert text ratings into numeric form
- Handle missing values
- Remove duplicate users
- Analyze product ratings
- Generate simple product recommendations

This project is built using **Python** and focuses on **real-world data preprocessing**.

## 🔧 Features
✔ Convert ratings like "five", "two" → numeric values  
✔ Handle missing age values  
✔ Remove duplicate user entries  
✔ Calculate average product rating  
✔ Find percentage of poor ratings  
✔ Recommend a product brand based on rating
